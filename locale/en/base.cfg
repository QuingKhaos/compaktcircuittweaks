compaktcircuittweaks-recipe-tech-overhaul=Remove [item=advanced-circuit] and [item=processing-unit] from compact processor recipes

[mod-setting-description]
compaktcircuittweaks-recipe-tech-overhaul=If enabled, compact processor recipes will no longer require [item=advanced-circuit] and [item=processing-unit]. Instead, they will require more basic components, making them easier to produce in the early game.\n\nThis change will also move the compact circuits technology directly after circuit networks in the tech tree and makes it cheaper to research.
